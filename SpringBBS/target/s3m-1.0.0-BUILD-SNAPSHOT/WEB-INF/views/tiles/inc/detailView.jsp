	Tiles allows authors to define page fragments which can be
	<b><font color="#11ffff">assembled into a complete pages at runtime.</font></b> These fragments, or tiles,
	can be used as simple includes in order to reduce the duplication of
	common page elements or embedded within other tiles to develop a series
	of reusable templates. These templates streamline the development of a
	consistent look and feel across an entire application.
